# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game made with C# and Windows Forms.
Pre-College study #2

# About this study exercise
This game was my second coding exercise, it was created to help me understand loops and arrays in C#.
## Previous stage
I had just created a Rock Paper Scissors game.

### Challenge 
My challenge was to create my own Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch and understand how to manage arrays and start using Lists in C#.
### Concepts Learned
I learned about multidimentional arrays and understood how to work with nested loops logic.
### Next Stage
My next step is to create a Minesweeper game, to better understand arrays and recursive functions
